  <h1>Research</h1>
  <p>Xiaosheng Huang leads a research team, with mostly undergraduate students, that has found the largest number of strong gravitational lens candidates using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. He leads large-scale observation programs for high resolution and spectroscopic confirmation of these candidates. His team has also developed the fastest lens modeling code, GIGA-Lens. He is the PI and Co-I of a number of significant programs on the Hubble Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. His team collaborates with the Supernova Cosmology Project, the Nearby Supernova Factory, and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as well as researchers at NSF's NOIRLab and the Space Telescope Science Institute.</p>
