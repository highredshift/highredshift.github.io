  <h1>Research</h1>
  <p>
    I lead a research team, with mostly undergraduate students, that has found the largest number of strong gravitational lens candidates using 
    cutting-edge machine learning techniques. I lead or co-lead several large-scale observation programs for high resolution and spectroscopic 
    confirmation of these candidates on DESI, VLT MUSE, and the Hubble Space Telescope. We also have developed the fastest lens modeling code, GIGA-Lens. 
    I am the PI, Co-PI, or Co-I of a number of significant programs on the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, 
    and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. My team collaborates with the Supernova Cosmology Project, Nearby Supernova Factory, 
    and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as well as researchers at NSF's NOIRLab 
    and the Space Telescope Science Institute.
