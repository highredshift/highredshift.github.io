<h1>Cosmology with the Carousel Lens</h1>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  One of our most exciting discoveries is the <strong>Carousel Lens</strong> (Figure 10, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909...27H/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
     Huang et&nbsp;al., 2021</a>, and it was featured in a 
  <a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/news/noirlab2104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    NOIRLab press release</a>; see also <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..259...27O/abstract' 
    target="_blank" rel="noopener"> O'Donnell et&nbsp;al., 2022</a>), a remarkable strong gravitational lens 
  system with <em> a large number of multiply-imaged background sources across many different redshifts</em>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We carried out spectroscopic confirmation with VLT/MUSE and constructed a successful lens model 
  (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...973....3S/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheu et&nbsp;al., 2024</a>; at the time of this paper, we identified 7 background sources).
  We showed that the main deflector of  this cluster scale lens is well-modeled by an elliptical power-law mass profile.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  With its uniquely rich set of multiple sources and a relaxed mass propile, the Carousel Lens provides an unprecedented laboratory 
  for precision cosmology. In upcoming work, we will use this system to place constraints on cosmological parameters.
