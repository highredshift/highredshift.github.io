  <h1>Cosmology</h1>
  <p>
    Strong lensing of quasars and supernovae provides direct measurements of the Hubble constant 
    and constraints on the dark energy equation of state. 
    By combining lensing time delays, stellar dynamics, and multi-wavelength data, 
    we aim to resolve the current tension in H<sub>0</sub> and advance our understanding of cosmic acceleration.
