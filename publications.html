  <h2>DESI Strong Lens Foundry Series</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Our group leads the <strong>DESI Strong Lens Foundry Series</strong>, a multi-paper effort 
    to discover, confirm, and model strong gravitational lenses in DESI imaging and spectroscopy.  
    This series involves collaborations between USF, LBNL, and the DESI collaboration, 
    with contributions from undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  
    Topics span machine-learning based searches, spectroscopic confirmation, lens modeling with 
    <em>GIGA-Lens</em>, and cosmological applications.
